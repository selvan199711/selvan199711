# Hi, I'm Thamilchselvan

I'm a Web Development student at Humber College, interested in building responsive websites and web apps. I enjoy working with JavaScript, Python, React, and other modern tools.

Currently learning full-stack development, and open to opportunities in junior development, QA, or technical support. I'm eager to grow in a collaborative, hands-on environment.
